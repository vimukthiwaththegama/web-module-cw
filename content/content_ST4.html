    <section id="healthcare-systems" class="section">
      <h2>Healthcare Systems and Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Access to quality healthcare varies around the world due to differing systems, funding, and infrastructure.
        Understanding these models helps in advocating for improvements and ensuring equitable access.
      </p>
      <h3>Major Healthcare Models</h3>
      <h4>Beveridge Model</h4>
      <p>
        Funded by taxes, this system provides universal coverage (e.g., the UK's NHS) with low out-of-pocket costs,
        though it may have longer wait times.
      </p>
      <h4>Bismarck Model</h4>
      <p>
        Based on employer and employee contributions, this model offers shorter wait times and more choice (e.g., Germany, France).
      </p>
      <h4>National Health Insurance Model</h4>
      <p>
        A single-payer system that combines private service delivery with government-funded insurance (e.g., Canada), reducing administrative costs.
      </p>
      <h4>Out-of-Pocket Model</h4>
      <p>
        Common in low-income regions, where individuals pay directly for services, often resulting in inequitable access.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h3>Barriers to Healthcare Access</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial:</strong> High costs, inadequate insurance, and catastrophic expenses</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic:</strong> Long distances and provider shortages</li>
        <li><strong>Structural:</strong> Complex systems and language or cultural barriers</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Improving Accessibility</h3>
